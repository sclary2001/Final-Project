## 📖 Narrative

This portfolio was created as a final project for a web development course. The goal was to build a clean, functional, and well-structured front-end web application.

I am currently a **2nd Lieutenant in the Alabama National Guard** and a **Computer Information Systems student at the University of North Alabama**. Before commissioning, I served **three years as an enlisted infantry soldier**. I graduated and commissioned from **Marion Military Institute** with my associate degree and completed military training at **Fort Benning, Georgia**.

I chose to build a personal portfolio because it is something I can continue using professionally. This project combines my military background with the web development concepts I learned during the semester.
